    "### Scientific Question: Is there a correlation between UV exposure and the rate melanoma diagnoses in men and women across the world? \n",
    "NASA'S use of the ozone mapping spectrometer has revealed that UV radiation levels vary across the world. Studies have shown this variation is in response to solar elevation, cloud and snow reflection, altitude, aerosols, and elliptical orbit of the Earth around the Sun (Liley and Mckenzie, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "Melanoma is a tumor that is generated when melanocytes become malignant. Melanocytes are responsible for producing the melanin in our bodies to display physical features such as eye, hair, and skin color. Research has shown that people who are more suseptable to having Melanoma are those who are consistently exposed to the sun, especially without sunscreen (Heistein and Acharya, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have also pointed to how individuals with lighter skin complexion, with the phenomelanin pigment, are more vunerable to developing Melanoma. The minimal erythematous (MED) dose method has been used to evaluate how much UV radiation is needed to induce sunburn. A much higher dose of (MED) is needed in individuals with darker complextion to induce suburn,because have the eumelanin pigment, which is less sensitive to UV (D'Orazio et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: If there is high exposure to UV radiation in a given location, then we can expect to see high rate of melanoma in both men and women. \n",
    "\n",
    "High exposure to UV radiation has been shown to lead to specific mutations in our genes causing severe skin damage. On the molecular level, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is most often mutated by UV radiation. In this pathway, the genes often affected are BRAF, NRAS, and NF1. There are two forms of UV Radiation, UVB and UVA. \"UVB causes DNA lesions directly\" whereas \"UVA excites intracellular photosensitizers and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species to induce DNA damage\"(Craig et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this scientific question and test my hypothesis, I searched for UV radiation levels across different countries in the world on the World Health Organization Website. I also searched for the rates of Melanoma for men and women (30+ yrs) on the American Institute for Cancer Research. I then transfered both forms of data onto Excel and turned them into a csv file. That is the data I used here. "

    "- Pandas: This is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool that can be used in Python. You can create DataFrames and it will provide tools for reading and writing data in different formats.It also allows you to merge, reshape, insert and delete columns in datasets. To learn more about Pandas, see: https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotly.express: This is a refined source within Plotly used to style and create different figures that may be basic, 2D, 3D, multidimensional, and even in the form of a a Polar Chart. The high level API for these functions makes it easy to transition to different types of figures. To learn more about Plotly.express, see: https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/\n",

    "- Statistics: This is a module in Python that allows you to calculate mathmatical statistics to numerical data. THis includes calculating the mean, median, mode, standard deviation and more. To learn more about Statistics, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy: This is a package that is used for scientific computing in Python. You can use it to create multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Several mathmatical opperations can be performed in these arrays with large amounts of data. To learn more about numpy, see: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- matplotlib.pyplot: This is a source within matplotlib that consists of functions that work similarly to Matlab. You can use it create figures more in detail by incorporating labels, lines, and can specify axes. To learn more about matplotlib.pyplot, see: https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- SciPy: This is a package created on the extension of NumPy that can be used for manipulating and visualizing data. SciPy has subpackages to create N-dimensional images, spatial data structures, statistical distributions, clustering algorithms and much more.

    "The first scatterplot illustrates that as the rate of melanoma increased among men, it did not necessarily mean there was high UV radiation in that location. For instance, at around 15% rate for melanoma, we see a UV radiation of about 1800. Later we see a 29% rate for melanoma, but a UV radiation level of around 1300. There is no correlation between the two variables which can be further supported by the p-value of 5.829 which is greater than the standard 0.05, which is not statistically significant.\n",

    "For The second scatterplot had the same results where as the rate of melanoma increased, there was no real increase in UV radiation. This is further supported by the large p-value of 2.869 which is greater than the standard 0.05, which is not statistically significant. \n",
    "\n",
